Description: Bicameralism (the philosophy of "two-chamberedness") is a hypothesis in psychology that argues that the human mind once assumed a state in which cognitive functions were divided between one part of the brain which appears to be "speaking", and a second part which listens and obeysâ€”a bicameral mind. This theme uses a decoupled front end built with React.js which plays the part of the "listener", while the Wordpress Rest API is the "speaker".
